============

Python: realizing multivariate, generic(k)  k mean classification algorithm, using numpys linear algebra


question in python (numpy)

what is more consuming?

reshaping Centers and Samples each time?
each itteration, reshaping again, meaning recaculating the reshape

or
reshaping Centers and Samples only once?
approacing the 3d matrics via Cents[0,:,k] or Samples[guess == k,:,0]
pro - reshaping only once
con - neet to approche the matrics using ":" and i=0 exc..
